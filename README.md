# speakerJS

This is a basic speaker modeling program, written in JavaScript, that runs in a browser. I used
to host this program at my personal web page, but I changed ISP's, and don't have that page
any more.

Today, you can use the same program by copying it to your local computer and running it there.

**Easy install in Windows**

* Click on the green button that says "Code," and choose "Download ZIP."

* Open the Zip file. You will find a folder "SpeakerJS-main." Drag it to your desktop, or some
other preferred file location.

* Open "SpeakerJS-Main" and double click on "speaker.html" which will open the program in
your browser.

**Open source information**

The file "speaker.html" contains the entirety of my source code, and is written in a plain
text editor with minimal decorations, so you can read the code. In addition, I use a
Javascript plotting program called Flot, which is in its own source code directory.
